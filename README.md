# Classic Pong Game

Hey, This is the classic Pong Game, 
There is ball that moves around the screen space and each player tries to save the ball hitting their side's wall.
If it does, other player gets a point.
Both the players get a paddle to save their territory from the ball.

I have used turtle python module for this.
I have also tried to made it interesting by adding some sounds using the winsound python module for windows OS.
This module is specifically for windows sounds but there exists similar modules for other Operating Systems also.
